### Training an assistant
> Python dialog skill discussion

I am super excited to share my latest experience with a new assistant that was trained with skills to dialog via web chat with guests about the Python programming language and, to research information that the training did not cover.  She will ocassionally suggest IBM products and services to further our reseller goals.

Michelle has graciously accepted the training challenge and you can look over my shoulder today as I dialog with her to test her newly acquired skills.


#### Perspective

In order to give my tests perspective I will take on several personas who dialog according to their quest.

* Beginner looking for resources
  - I need a tutorial
  - Can you suggest a course
  - Can you suggest some youtube videos

* Chief information officer
  - What is python used for
  - Where is python used
  - Who is using python

* New grad looking for work
  - Are you hiring
  - Where can I find work

* Advanced python programmer
  - Object Orientation
  - Functional
  - paradigm
  - semantic
      + assignment
      + iterator
      + flow control
      + operator
  - patterns

#### Techniques
* Enabling web chat
* Back up the dialog skills
* Connecting to a search skill
* HTML formatted text responses
* searching for an intent or entity in the dialog
* recognizing an entity and responding with slots
* disambiguation - ie iterator
